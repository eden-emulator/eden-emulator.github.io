## Welcome! 

We're excited to announce the launch of the official **eden emulator blog**! this blog will serve as a place to talk about development, new features, bugfixes, and rant about our changes. 

## What to expect

Individual developers and community members will post blogs, and we will occasionally post all-encompassing progress reports, general development updates, and information for packagers.

Some of the topics we'll cover on the blog include:

- **Development Updates**: Get the latest information about new features, improvements, and bug fixes
- **Technical Articles**: Deep dives into how Eden works under the hood
- **Community Highlights**: Showcasing amazing work from our community members
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides to help you get the most out of Eden
- **Troubleshooting, Tips & Tricks**: Tips on how to recognize issues to start understanding what settings might be able to improve your experience

## Why we're doing this

A lot of open-source projects have interesting and valuable information hidden in private conversations, changelogs and discord servers. 
This blog will be our space to share the things we deem worthy of sharing with the community,

Here are some of the benefits of having a blog:

1. keep you informed about what we're working on
2. share our technical decisions and the reasoning behind them
3. celebrate milestones and achievements
4. build a stronger connection with our community, sounds cheesy, but we mean it.
